# Getting Started

Since there are a few options, this page is about helping you find what package best suits your needs.

The following 4 options are available:

- **Preview** for displaying thumbnails. If your `src` points to an external provider such as YouTube,
  we'll load in the thumbnail for you. It comes with a skeleton loading animation and optional play button.

- **Lite** for a simple player embed. The difference between Lite and traditional Player SDKs is:

  - **Loaded lazily**. See the benefits of lazy loading [here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video).
  - Utilizes **preconnections** for an approximately [224x faster load](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed).
  - **Lighter by about 50% on average and minimal overhead**. For example, if you normally wanted to embed a video from YouTube, Dailymotion and
    Vimeo, the total Player SDK cost would be ~25 kB. In contrast, with Vime it'll be about ~8 kB, and any
    additional Lite player from a different provider would only increase that cost by about ~1-1.5 kB.
  - You send commands and receive messages from the embed via [postmessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
    However, we take the pain out of it by storing your commands and sending them when the player is ready
    for playback, and we decode any messages received into a POJO.

* **Standard** for when you want all Lite features, and you want to interact with the provider/embed
  through the core Vime player interface (not via `postmessage`). Thus, you avoid browser/provider differences and get access
  to the store.

* **Complete** for when you want all Lite and Standard features + custom controls, multi-provider support, internationalization,
  and plugins.
