# Getting Started

Since there are a few options, this page is about helping you find what package best suits your needs. 

The following options are available:

1. **Preview** for displaying thumbnails.
2. **Lite** for embedding a player.
3. **Standard** for embedded players that are plugged into the Vime core.
4. **Complete** for the core Vime player with multi-provider and plugins support.
