# SeekControl `Component`

[View Source](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/packages/vime-player/src/plugins/controls/control/SeekControl.svelte)

A control that enables the user to seek to a new time. It works by having a base value (+/-) and multiplying
it for each press by the user. If the base is 10 seconds, after 3 presses it would seek forward 30 seconds.
If the base was -10 seconds, then it would seek backwards 30 seconds.

## Props

### `base: int`

**Default:** `0`

The base amount to multiply by on each press. If the number is positive it will seek forward, and if its negative
it will seek backward.

### `isEnabled: boolean`

**Default:** `true`

Whether to render the control in the DOM or not.

### `isActive: boolean`

**Default:** `false`

Whether the control is visible or not.

## Methods

### `getEl(): HTMLElement`

The root component HTML element.

### `getControl(): Control`

The underlying `Control` (see <LinkTo kind="packages-player-plugins-controls-control-control--page">Controls/Control</LinkTo>) instance.
