# Menu `Component`

[View Source](https://github.com/vime-js/vime/blob/master/packages/vime-player/src/plugins/settings/menu/Menu.svelte)

A menu is a container for a list of choices. A choice is an interactable that performs some action. 
It is represented in the DOM as a `button` with a role of `menuitem` or `menuitemradio`. Choices can 
be grouped together by nesting menus, hence creating submenus (see <LinkTo kind="packages-player-plugins-settings-menu-submenu-submenu--page">Submenu/Submenu</LinkTo>).

üìù The main children of this component are the `MenuItem` (see <LinkTo kind="packages-player-plugins-settings-menu-menuitem--page">Menu/MenuItem</LinkTo>) 
and `MenuOptions` (see <LinkTo kind="packages-player-plugins-settings-menu-menuoptions--page">Menu/MenuOptions</LinkTo>) components.
