# How it Works

***This document is still a work in progress.***

This is section dives deeper into how the plugin system works, this is mostly useful if you want to
build your own plugins or controls.

## Lifecycle

Plugins are Svelte components that implement the plugin interface (see <LinkTo kind="api-plugin--page">API/Plugin</LinkTo>) and 
add some functionality/feature to the player. They are managed by the `PluginsManager` whose responsible 
for validating, adding, removing, rendering and registering them. It can be accessed through the player 
by calling `player.getPluginsManager()` and you can refer to  <LinkTo kind="api-pluginsmanager--page">API/PluginsManager</LinkTo> 
for more information.

1. Validate the plugin to make sure it implements the <LinkTo kind="api-plugin--page">`Plugin`</LinkTo> interface.
2. Mount the plugin on the DOM using [`svelte:component`](https://svelte.dev/docs#svelte_component).
3. The rendered instance is registered with the managers `Registry` (more on this later).
4. The `Registry` dispatches an event to the root so the player can attach the plugin to itself.
1. When it's time (player/plugin is being destroyed) the plugin is unmounted from the DOM.
2. The managers `Registry` is notified via a callback that the component has been destroyed and deregisters it.
3. Finally, the `Registry` dispatches an event to the root so the player can deattach the plugin.

## Registry

Plugins and their child values are registered using a `Registry` (see <LinkTo kind="api-registry--page">API/Registry</LinkTo>).
A registry is essentially a container who holds unique id references to values. Majority of time, 
these values are rendered plugin instances (the result of mounting a Svelte component to the DOM), or
other registries (known as subregistries).

### Problem

The problem that the registry solves is, how do we access and communicate between semi-unrelated
component trees. Basically, if we create a plugin called `MySuperDuperPlugin`, then how does
`OtherSuperDuperPlugin` interact with it.

The [registry pattern](https://wiki.c2.com/?RegistryPattern) in Vime helps answers those questions.

### Solution

All you need to know is:

- In Vime, there is a global object called a registry in which all shared values are stored. 
- These objects can be nested in one another to create subregistries.
- Subregistries are created by plugins.
- You access subregistries through the root registry, stored under their respective plugin `ID`.
- The only "special" subregistry is the `vPlugins` registry which holds all plugin instances.
- You can access the root registry by calling `player.getRegistry()`.
- You can access the plugins subregistry by calling `player.getPluginsRegistry()`.

### Flow

1. The `Player` creates a root `Registry` on initialization.
2. Once the player has mounted, the `PluginsManager` is mounted and creates a subregistry (the `vPlugins` registry).
3. The `PluginsManger` renders plugins and registers their instances in its subregistry.
4. Finally, each plugin may decide to create its own subregistry to register child components or anything else.
