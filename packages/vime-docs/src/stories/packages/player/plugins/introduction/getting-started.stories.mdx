# Plugins

Plugins are at the heart of Vime because everything outside of the core is built as one. Basically plugins
are Svelte components that implement the plugin interface (see <LinkTo kind="api-plugin--page">API/Plugin</LinkTo>) and 
add some functionality/feature to the player. Plugins can be interacted with through the props,
methods and events they expose.

## Installing Plugins

### Quick

You can get started quickly by simply using the `Boot` plugin which will install everything. It 
also provides the option of turning off certain plugins, see <LinkTo kind="packages-player-plugin-boot--page">Plugins/Boot</LinkTo>.

```js
import { Player, Boot } from '@vime-js/player';

// ...

const player = new Player({ 
  target,
  props: {
    plugins: [Boot]
  }
});
```

### Modular

If you want more control then you can pick and use only what you need.

```js
import { 
  Player, ActionDisplay, Keyboard, 
  Tooltips 
} from '@vime-js/player';

// ...

const player = new Player({ 
  target,
  props: {
    plugins: [ActionDisplay, Keyboard, Tooltips]
  }
});
```

### Dynamic

If you want to dynamically add/remove plugins you can use the 
`PluginsManager` (see <LinkTo kind="api-pluginsmanager--page">API/PluginsManager</LinkTo>).

📝 You can still do this with the `plugins` prop, but the manager has a much better interface for this.

⚠️ Svelte batches tasks to be performed asynchronously. Therefore, if you are dynamically adding and removing 
plugins they will not be mounted/unmounted straight away. You have 4 options for this case:

1. Call `player.tick()` after the change and wait for it to resolve.
2. Wait for the plugin manager's respective add/remove method to resolve.
3. Listen to the `pluginmount` and `plugindestroy` events on the player for updates.
4. Subscribe to the relevant registry to be notified of changes.

```js
import { ActionDisplay, Keyboard, Tooltips } from '@vime-js/player';

const pluginsManager = player.getPluginsManager();

pluginsManager
  .addPlugins([ActionDisplay, Keyboard, Tooltips])
  .then([actionDisplay, keyboard, tooltips] => {
    // ...
  });

// ...

pluginsManager
  .removePlugin(Keyboard)
  .then(() => {
    // ...
  });
```

## Interacting with Plugins

All Vime plugins are attached to the player and can be accessed via their plugin `ID`.  All Vime plugins 
follow the naming convention of `v{PluginName}`. 

**Examples**

- Keyboard = `vKeyboard`
- ActionDisplay = `vActionDisplay`
- Controls = `vControls`

### JavaScript

⚠️ Only plugins included during initialization (when creating the player) are available immediately inside 
the `mount` event.

```js
player.$on('mount', () => {
  player.vKeyboard.doSomething();
});
```

For more advanced use cases you could do the following.

```js
import { PlayerEvent, Keyboard } from '@vime-js/player';

player.$on(PlayerEvent.PLUGIN_MOUNT, e => {
  const { id, plugin } = e.detail;
  
  if (id === Keyboard.ID) { 
    // Keyboard plugin mounted.
  }
});

player.$on(PlayerEvent.PLUGIN_DESTROY, e => {
  const id = e.detail;
  
  if (id === Keyboard.ID) {
    // Keyboard plugin destroyed.
  }
});
```

### Svelte

```html
<Player
  {plugins}
  on:mount={onPlayerMount}
  bind:this={player}
/>

<script>
  import { Player, Keyboard } from '@vime-js/player';

  let player;

  const plugins = [Keyboard];

  const onPlayerMount = () => {
    player.vKeyboard.doSomething();
  };
</script>
```

For more advanced use cases you could do the following.

```html
<Player
  {plugins}
  on:mount={onPlayerMount}
  bind:this={player}
/>

<script>
  import { Player, Keyboard } from '@vime-js/player';

  let player;
  let registry;

  const plugins = [Keyboard];

  const onPlayerMount = () => {
    registry = player.getPluginsRegistry();
  };

  // Because the registry has a subscribe method, we can take advantage of auto-subscriptions.
  $: keyboardPlugin = $registry && $registry[Keyboard.ID];

  $: if (keyboardPlugin) {
    // ...
  }
</script>
```
