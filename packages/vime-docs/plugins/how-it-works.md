# How it Works

This is section dives deeper into how the plugin system works, this is mostly useful if you want to
build your own plugins or controls.

## Lifecycle

Plugins are Svelte components that implement the [plugin interface](../complete/api/plugin.md) and 
add some functionality/feature to the player. They are managed by the [`PluginsManager`](../complete/api/plugins-manager.md) 
whose responsible for validating, adding, removing, rendering and registering them. It can be accessed through the player 
by calling `player.getPluginsManager()`.

### Create

1. Validate the plugin to make sure it implements the plugin interface.
2. Mount the plugin on the DOM using [`svelte:component`][svelte-component].
3. The rendered instance is registered with the managers `Registry` (more on this later).
4. The `Registry` dispatches an event to the root so the player can attach the plugin to itself.

### Destroy

5. When it's time (player/plugin is being destroyed) the plugin is unmounted from the DOM.
6. The managers `Registry` is notified via a callback that the component has been destroyed and deregisters it.
7. Finally, the `Registry` dispatches an event to the root so the player can deattach the plugin.

## Registry

Plugins and their child values are registered using a [`Registry`](../complete/api/registry.md). A registry 
is essentially a container who holds unique id references to values. Majority of time, these values are 
rendered plugin instances (the result of mounting a Svelte component to the DOM), or other registries (known as subregistries).

### Problem

The problem that the registry solves is, how do we access and communicate between semi-unrelated
component trees that are dynamically rendered and removed. Basically, if we create a plugin called 
`MySuperDuperPlugin`, then how does `OtherSuperDuperPlugin` listen for when it becomes
available and get a reference to it.

### Solution

The [registry pattern][wiki-registry-pattern] is the approach used in Vime to solve the mentioned problem.

All you need to know is:

- In Vime, there is a global object called a registry in which all shared values are stored. 
- These objects can be nested in one another to create subregistries.
- Subregistries are created by plugins.
- You access subregistries through the root registry, stored under their respective plugin `ID`.
- The only "special" subregistry is the `vPlugins` registry which holds all plugin instances.
- You can access the root registry by calling `player.getRegistry()`.
- You can access the plugins subregistry by calling `player.getPluginsRegistry()`.

### Flow

1. The `Player` creates a root `Registry` on initialization.
2. Once the player has mounted, the `PluginsManager` is mounted and creates a subregistry (the `vPlugins` registry).
3. The `PluginsManger` renders plugins and registers their instances in its subregistry.
4. Finally, each plugin may decide to create its own subregistry to register child components or anything else.

Now that you understand how the plugin system works, you can [start](../guides/creating-plugin.md)
building your very own plugin.
